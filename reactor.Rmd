#### Q - In what ways is the table tidy? How is it not tidy? Whatâ€™s different about it from a tidy table?
#### A - The table is not tidy. There are variables that are repeating themselves and that doesn't make a tody table. A tidy table would have a row with no variables repeating and have columns with similar data in them.

#### Most of the nuclear reactors use BWR - Boiling water reactor and PWR - Pressurized water reactor
